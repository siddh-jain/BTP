Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) is a crucial parameter for understanding atmospheric dynamics. We have compared PBLH observations with CMIP6 models over India. The analysis aims to assess the long-term trends and discrepancies between the two datasets, providing valuable insights for climate research.
